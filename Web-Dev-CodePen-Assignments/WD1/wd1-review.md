# Web Dev 1 (Week 1 Web Dev Assignment)

Original Project Link (CodePen): https://codepen.io/davideast/pen/MWxvzjm

Original Project Author: @davideast

This CodePen is something I'd like to use in my own web dev projects, particularly for button press user feedback (user knows when the button should be pressed, has been pressed, and/or can't be pressed).
I tried changing: 
  - the button border color from orange to other colors
  - the speed and amount of movement of serveral of the button animations
    
I could not implement these changes to my 'website' because the Web Dev 1 assignment instructions are vague ("Download the code and upload it to your website." Does that mean our github? Are we supposed to get rid of what's currently on our 'website' from recetation? Do we replace what's currently in our index.html code? Do we just upload the zip file or copy/paste the code from the CodePen into new files under our css and js files?) and we haven't gone over what this process is intended to look like.
