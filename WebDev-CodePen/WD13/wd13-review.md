## Reflection & Changes
- I remade this CodePen to implement its shine transition into the layout of my JS final (frustrating phone number) because I liked the transition and figured this was a good way to work on my JS final along with completing my Web Dev assignment for this week. I started adding the CSS and JS for the cards to flip over when clicked, but I didn't fully implement that yet, only began to. This CodePen was also helpful for practicing my ability to reconfigure existing code for my own purposes. With more time, I would have began writing my JS final code into this CodePen, or maybe just use it to test different layouts for my JS final.
### My Changes:
  - Changed to 20 small cards (reminiscent of buttons) from single shiny fact card
  - Changed to grid layout from flex layout
  - Changed h1 tags to be divs
  - Added front and back card faces as divs (only one at time of this submission)
  - Added/removed classes for styling and JS functionality
  - Although I didn't have time to finish adding in the card flipping (on click) functionality, let alone the matching game functionality that I'm using in my JS final, I did layout 20 versions of the cards and play around with the html tagging and structuring. This meant that I didn't end up using a lot of the existing parts of this CodePen, like the styling on the different info portions of the single shiny fact card. Fortunately, the shine transition (on hover) still looks good and works well on smaller cards. Additionally, I played around with different layout techniques, but settled on a grid layout being the best for my purposes (as opposed to flex on 4 or 5 containers of list elements) because it's gonna allow for me to easily add 2 or 3 alternative layouts as media queries for different viewing window sizes.
