## Reflection & Changes
- I was drawn to this CodePen because quite honestly, it was pretty and easy. I haven't been particularly drawn to many of the other photo frame CodePens that I've seen. Furthermore, I love neon and glow effects, so this gave me an opportunity to develop my CSS skills while working on something that I enjoyed looking at throughout the entire process. Another reason I was excited by this specific CodePen was because it was responsive and made it fairly straightforward to understand that responsiveness. So to summarize, I liked the aesthetic of this CodePen more than other similar ones that I've seen, it felt pretty easy to understand / work with, and it gave me an opportunity to develop my responsive web styling skills. I will likely use this CodePen (parts of it) in future projects, and may continue modifying it as a way to practice responsive web styling.
### My Changes:
  - Added lemonade flavors text to cards
  - Aligned text
  - Font from Poppins to Calibri
  - Card WxH dimensions from 280x400 (px) to 290x406 (px) to fit 5x7 aspect ratio
  - Card glow blur from 16px to 32px
  - Card glow saturation from 100% (default) to 150%
  - Page background from solid #1d031f to radial gradient of that color (until 33%) outward into black
  - My original idea was to frame photos of myself in these cards. I cropped three recent photos of myself from a recent trip at an aspect ratio of 5x7 and then resized the card dimensions to match that ratio. Instead of then immediately trying to put in my photos as the background, I looked through the rest of the existing styling and began playing around with different things. This included changing the blur size, adding the saturation filter, and changing the page background from solid to a radial gradient. I then went into the html to realize that these cards were designed for text, not images. So I uncommented the existing commented-out p elements and then chenged the font, alignment, and text itself. My idea at this point was to then add my photos within the cards but at a smaller scale, only taking up maybe 60-75% of the card, not all of it (enclosed within the card border). I tried doing this in a few different places in the styling, but ran into issues every time. Eventually, I was able to fill the cards, but then couldn't figure out how to resize the photos to fully fit within the cards. I decided this was all good enough for the time being.
