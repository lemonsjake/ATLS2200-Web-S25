## Reflection & Changes
- I chose this CodePen because I love this glow effect and flicker animation. It looks really good with Japanese characters especially. I plan on adding some JavaScript into it and adding a moving wireframe background that's illuminated when the sign flickers. This is something I would use on a personal website or portfolio and is something that goes really well with some of the other CodePens I've edited for previous Web Dev assignments. I'm very excited to continue making my own version of this CodePen and executing my vision!
### My Changes:
  - Text content to "ãƒ¬ãƒ¢ãƒ³ã‚º" from "æ–‰æœ¨æ¥ é›„"
  - I played around and made various changes but didn't like them, so I ended up only keeping the change of the text content. Originally, the text content was Japanese Kanji characters, but I changed them to Japanese katakana characters spelling out "Lemons". Some of the changes I made that I didn't keep included changing the background from dark purple to black, changing the border radius of the sign, and changing the font. I will end up reintegrating these changes, but I'll do so in a better way, such as adding in the moving vaporwave wireframe page background on sign illumination that I mentioned in my Reflection above. The border radius and font go hand-in-hand, meaning that the curved sign edges didn't look good with any of the fonts I tried, and I wasn't a big fan of any of the fonts themselves. I have something in mind, but need more time to execute the vision. Lastly, I will make the sign responsive and easier to place at different points on the page so that I can begin using it in other designs and webpage layouts.
