## Waves Text

### Reflection
  - The short answer to what drew me to this particular CodePen is that I just love waves and it was a pleasant surprise when I clicked on this CodePen and found that the waves simply scaled with text.
    The long answer is that there's a lot of the same types of tools and code on Spark CodePens. It's difficult to find truly unique things that are ALSO scalable / easy to implement.
    Another piece that drew me to this CodePen was that it was made by someone I hadn't seen other CodePens from. That is to say, there are some people on CodePen that are always in the 'popular' section and they have they're own layout/theme and coding practices.
    Some of them use almost exclusively div elements while others use sections and more. On the plus-side, these are usually high-quality CodePens that work well and are interesting. 
    The negatives though are that these CodePens feel washed-out or overused, or they're the opposite and too niche to easily modify with only beginner/intermediate web dev skills.
    I chose this CodePen because it has aspects I like (waves), is unique and/or made by someone I hadn't seen CodePens from before, and is almost entirely CSS, with only a line or two of HTML and no JS.
### My Changes:
  - Font/text size
  - Text content
  - Text content color from 0xfefcef (off-white) to 0xfff (white)
  - At first, I only changed the text content from "WAVES" to "LEMONS" and messed around with capitalization. I then began experimenting with multi-line text and spacing before then playing around with different fonts and text sizes.
    By that point, I started changing the color(s) a bit. I changed the off-white background to be truly white (after trying other colors, greys, and black) as well as changing the blue in the wave to be white, yellow, purple, green, and many other colors before eventually deciding to keep the original blue, mostly because of how it all looked with that blue's background wave shade/color.
    Finally, I settled on making a crude art project using the CodePen by applying my creativity and changing nothing but the colors, font, and sizing.
