### Original Project Author & Link (CodePen):

## Reflection & Changes
- I liked how this CodePen looked and its overall aesthetic. My original idea was to play around with everything from the colors, to spacing, to fonts, to thicknesses, and more, but I dodn't make enough time to digest thie CodePen as much as I wanted to.
### My Changes:
  - Changed 'OCEANIC' card bottom left 'VIEW' link to link back to my page.
  - Changed 'SYSTEM' card bottom right 'READ' link to link back to my page.
  - Date from 10.04.25 to today's date, 04.13.25
  - I wanted to change more things, but didn't have the time to look over this CodePen in as much depth as I would have like to. I will refer back to this CodePen down the line as a sort of guide to integrating JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I would have liked to change the colors of the cards more and marbe played around with line thicknesses and negative space as well as the font, which I like but feel like could be better. Changing the links was pretty easy and straightforward as was changing the date.
