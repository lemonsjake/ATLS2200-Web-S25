## Reflection & Changes
- I chose this CodePen because I wanted to apply a similar background effect to my midterm CSS project. I wasn't able to get the exact result I wanted, but I got pretty close. The primary challenge was having to use only 3 colors in addition to black and white. My midterm project has a neon glow aesthetic using white, light-blue, pink, and purple, all on a black background to stand out. The color scheme looks great on my project, but not great on this CodePen when on a black background. This CodePen even has a light/dark mode where all the colors invert, but that ended up just making this Pen slightly more annoying to figure out and edit. I did however learn a lot from working on this, such as a better understanding of gradients and filters, as well as using custom variables and properties. Even though my version of this Pen doesn't look great compared to the original version, I learned a lot and am now more confident in my ability to make the background that I want for my midterm project!
### My Changes:
  - Main title text to "LEMONS" from "An awesome title"
  - Sub title text to "light/dark" from "switch bg"
  - Gradient ray lines to my light-blue, pink, and purple from original pastel green, blue, and pink
  - Background color to black from white
  - Made gradient rays fully vertical instead of at their slight slant
  - Made one gradient move right while other moves left
  - Increased blur on gradients
  - Reduced saturation filter on gradients to 150% from 200%
  - Removed invert filters
  - Removed mask on gradients used to cut off the gradient rays halfway through the page
  - I made a few other minute changes too, but writing them here is tedious. After quickly changing the text content, I changed the colors from the originals to my midterm project colors. It was also pretty straightforward to make the gradient rays align vertically instead of at the slanted angle, as well as to After this, I spent a while trying to make the default background black instead of white without inverting the other colors. During that process, I removed all of the invert filters and masks. Along with these were a couple other filter effects like blur and saturation, so I played around with those too until settling on an increased blur and decreased saturation on the gradient rays. I may use the original CodePen sometime for another project because I do really like it and it's relatively simple to work with while achieving some very nice effects.
