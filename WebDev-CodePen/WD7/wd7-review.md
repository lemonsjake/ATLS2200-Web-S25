## Reflection & Changes
- When I first came across this CodePen, I immediately knew what I wanted to do for this week's Web Dev assignment. The profile pic that's now incorporated into my version of this CodePen is one that I've used for several years and love. The shade of blue shown in the border of the original CodePen (and this version) is nearly the same as the shade in the profile picture. As I've stated in some of my past CodePen reflections, I've been wanting to make at least one nice frame that I can use for situations like this, whether it be a profile picture I like or real photo of me. I plan to further refine my version of this CodePen to get it exactly how I want it and make it a responsive web design so I can incorporate it in more places with very minimal effort.
### My Changes:
  - Size to fit vertical profile picture
  - Background from solid gray to profile picture
  - Speed from 4s to 2s
  - Blur from 25px to 20px
  - Border radius to match slightly rounded corners
  - I first started by resizing the framed section to make it vertical and then I changed its background from a solid gray to my profile picture. After this, I tried changing most of the units from pixel values to be responsive/relative values like vw, vh, and percentages; however, the more I did this, the worse the result became in appearance even though the responsiveness was working. So eventually, I decided to go back to pixel values for this initial submission and make a note in my review that I plan to make a responsive version of this CodePen next or soon. I also played around a little bit with changing the blur effect on the the border, but settled on only decreasing it by 5 pixels to make the glow pop a bit more. Some other changes I attempted to make but then decided not to keep was changing the blue, changing the edge/border radius/roundness to rectangular, changing it to be super rounded forming an oval, changing the background gray to black, and adding an alternating direction to the border glow animation. One additional change I made that I did keep however, was making the border twice as thick on all sides. It's something I may revert later, but I like it for now at least.
