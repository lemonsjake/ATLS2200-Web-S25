## Reflection & Changes
- When I first came across this CodePen, I immediately knew what I wanted to do for this wekk's Web Dev assignment. The profile pic that's now incorperated into my version of this CodePen is one that I've used for several years and love. The shade of blue shown in the border of the original CodePen (and this version) is nearly the same as the shade in the profile picture. As I've stated in some of my past CodePen reflections, I've been wanting to make at least one nice frame that I can use for situations like this, whether it be a profile picture I like or real photo of me. I plan to further refine my version of this CodePen to get it exactly how I want it and make it a responsive web design so I can incorperate it in more places with very minimal effort.
### My Changes:
  - Size to fit vertical profile picture
  - Background from solid gray to profile picture
  - Speed from 4s to 2s
  - Blur from 25px to 20px
  - Border radius to match slightly rounded corners
  - I first started by resizing the My original idea was to frame photos of myself in these cards. I cropped three recent photos of myself from a recent trip at an aspect ratio of 5x7 and then resized the card dimensions to match that ratio. Instead of then immediately trying to put in my photos as the background, I looked through the rest of the existing styling and began playing around with different things. This included changing the blur size, adding the saturation filter, and changing the page background from solid to a radial gradient. I then went into the html to realize that these cards were designed for text, not images. So I uncommented the existing commented-out p elements and then chenged the font, alignment, and text itself. My idea at this point was to then add my photos within the cards but at a smaller scale, only taking up maybe 60-75% of the card, not all of it (enclosed within the card border). I tried doing this in a few different places in the styling, but ran into issues every time. Eventually, I was able to fill the cards, but then couldn't figure out how to resize the photos to fully fit within the cards. I decided this was all good enough for the time being.
