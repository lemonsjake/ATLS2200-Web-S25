### Reflection
    This is a CodePen that I can see myself playing around with further to make some neat animations (or maybe add hardware to make some cool art) for either myself, my Pathway to Space Portfolio, or as gifts for people in my life. It could be a loading animation or just a little something added to the bottom of a website.
### My Changes:
  - Sun (center) color from orange to gold
  - Oribitting dot color from pink to white
  - Oribitting dot color from blue to green
  - Orbit 2 animation time from 5s to 6s
  - Orbit 3 animation time from 10s to 9s
