# Web Dev 2 (Week 2 Web Dev Assignment)

This CodePen is something I'd like to use in my own web dev projects, particularly for button press user feedback (user knows when the button should be pressed, has been pressed, and/or can't be pressed).
I sucessfully changed:
  - all colors from orange-based colors to green-based colors
  - the speed and amount of movement of some of the button animations ("Shake: 20px to 10px"; "Glitch: 180deg to 80deg"; "Tony Hawk: 900 to 1080")
