## Reflection & Changes
- I chose this CodePen because it's been in my pinned CodePens for a while now, and I wanted to try it out now because we've started learning JavaScript. I want to use this card as a personal website addition or emblem in various different places because it would be a super neat 'easter-egg'-type of thing to find then hover on and get an unexpected response from hovering over it in different ways. I was disappointed that I couldn't manage to get this CodePen to work the way it's supposed to, but I plan on remaking it piece by piece until I get it fully functioning. I definitly sholuld've stopped much earlier and worked on a different CodePen for this week's Web Dev assignment, but I kept thinking I was close to figuring out the problem, even if I wouldn't have been able to fix it in time. Alas, I was wrong üò•
### My Changes:
  - Removed option to type in custom image url
  - Changed card photo to my cyborg profile pic
  - Attempted other changes to try to get interactive hovering to work, but nothing worked so I didn't keep them.
  - For some reason, I couldn't get the hover effects to work for me. I tried several different things including removing the the custom image url input, changing the background image, changing the page background color, using a different browser, and resizing some different things, but none of it worked unfortunately. I want to figure this out so I can use this! This is the exact kind of CodePen that I would've incorporated into this week's assignment, weekly assignment 11 (Image Carousel) where the main displayed image was displayed as a card like this CodePen and could be interacted with.
