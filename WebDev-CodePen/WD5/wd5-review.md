## Reflection & Changes
- I was drawn to this CodePen because I've loved space for as long as I can remmeber, and I stargaze or at least watch the moon for a few minutes nearly every night. As such, I find this animation fitting to use as a loading animation or perhaps just a fun footer animation for a personal website, portfolio, and/or my ePortfolio that's required for my Pathways to Space class that I'm currently taking for my Space Minor. When I first glanced at the CodePen and noticed that it was 98% just CSS (the current language we're learning/practicing), I figured it would be a good way to practice CSS without being bogged down by additional HTML and JavaScript. It turned out to be more difficult to change the CodePen in the ways that I envisioned and I eventually (after a little over an hour) decided to keep the original animation the same for the most part (aside from the speed and circle color). Hopefully we'll cover in class this week some of the components I was struggling with so that I can return to this CodePen and try to achieve some more of the results I'd like.
### My Changes:
  - Animation speed from 5s to 3s
  - Circle (moon) color from blue to white
  - At first, I changed the background to be true black instead of the dark charcoal gray it was originally. I decided I liked that original charcoal color the best, so I kept it. I attempted to change the size of the circle (moon) and animation, but couldn't get it to work. Furthermore, I played around with the 'keyframes' at-rule waypoints to try to geta few different animations including a planet transit that started slower and smaller, grew larger at the center of the white circle, and then would end slower and smaller again. This lead me to then try to make a different animation similar to that, but instead of changing speed at different points, the planet object (the one that clips the moon dark to create the moon phase) would grow larger from nothing just right of the moon and then shrink back into nothing on the opposing moon side after growing at the center of the moon like before. At some point, I attempted to make the planet object rotate perfectly around the moon, speeding up as it traveled clockwise toward the bottom and then slowing down on the opposing side as it returned to the top. I was unsuccessful with all of these attempts as well, even after using MDN documentation on the 'keyframes' at-rule. If I spent another hour or two with it, I'm sure I could figure it out, but right now I'm happy with my efforts regardless of the success (or lack thereof, I suppose). There were a few other things I tried, but I'll leave those out for the sake of response-length.
