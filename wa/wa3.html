            <strong>Solarpunk</strong> is a literary and artistic movement,
            close to the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopepunk">hopepunk</a>
            movement, that envisions and works toward actualizing a sustainable
            future interconnected with nature and community. The "solar"
            represents solar energy as a renewable energy source and an
            optimistic vision of the future that rejects climate doomerism,
            while the "punk" refers to do it yourself and the countercultural,
            post-capitalist, and sometimes decolonial aspects of creating such a
            future.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a science fiction literary subgenre and art movement, solarpunk
            works to address how the future might look if humanity succeeded in
            solving major contemporary challenges with an emphasis on
            sustainability, human impact on the environment, and addressing
            climate change and pollution. Especially as a subgenre, it is
            aligned with cyberpunk derivatives, and may borrow elements from
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopian_and_dystopian_fiction"
              >utopian</a
            >
            and fantasy genres.
          </p>
          <p>
            Solarpunk serves as a foil to the cyberpunk genre, particularly
            within the fashion industry. Both genres create and consolidate
            post-industrial countercultures; Solarpunk incites rebellion through
            its depiction of protoenvironmental socioecological relationships,
            whereas Cyberpunk advances the theme of rebellion through detached
            secondary environments, which often takes place in tangible
            dataspheres, virtual landscapes, and dystopian urban environments.
            Solarpunk draws inspiration from Bohemian style. The convergence of
            environmentalism and art serve as a framework for both subgenres.
            Solarpunk's interpretation of social collectivism strongly contrasts
            the individuality of Bohemian counterculture; Solarpunk recognizes
            individuality as an integral component of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism"
              >progressivism</a
            >
            and identifies sociocultural distinctions as an impetus for change,
            though solarpunk encompasses these elements within the greater
            socioecological scaffolding in a manner that contrasts the Bohemian
            assertion that individuality alone acts as the sole impetus for
            change.

          <p>
            The term solarpunk was coined in 2008 in a blog post titled "From
            Steampunk to Solarpunk", in which the anonymous author, taking the
            design of the MS Beluga Skysails (the world's first ship partially
            powered by a computer-controlled kite rig) as inspiration,
            conceptualizes a new speculative fiction subgenre with steampunk's
            focal point on specific technologies but guided by practicality and
            modern economics. Along a similar vein, in 2009, literary publicist
            Matt Staggs posted a "GreenPunk Manifesto" on his blog describing
            his vision of a technophilic genre focused on knowable, do it
            yourself technologies and with emphasis on positive ecological and
            social change. After visual artist Olivia Louise posted concept art
            on Tumblr of a solarpunk aesthetic in 2014, researcher Adam Flynn
            contributed to the science fiction forum Project Hieroglyph with
            further definition of the emerging genre. Based on Flynn's notes and
            contributions on the website solarpunks.net, A Solarpunk Manifesto
            was published in 2019. It describes solarpunk as "a movement in
            speculative fiction, art, fashion, and activism that seeks to answer
            and embody the questions 'what does a sustainable civilization look
            like, and how can we get there?'". In 2024, solarpunk entered The
            Encyclopedia of Science Fiction. Here, James Machell points to Songs
            from the Stars by Norman Spinrad as the subgenre's first text, and
            goes on to contrast solarpunk with
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a>,
            stating, "It is a rebellion against a rebellion, born out of
            dystopia fatigue."

          <h3 id="renewable_energy">Renewable Energy</h3>
          <p>
            While solarpunk has no specific political ideation, it does by
            default embrace the need for a collective movement away from
            polluting forms of energy. It practices prefigurative politics,
            creating spaces where the principles of a movement can be explored
            and demonstrated by enacting them in real life. Solarpunks practice
            the movement in various ways, including creating and living in
            communities (such as
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecovillages">ecovillages</a
            >), growing their own food, and a DIY ethic of working with what is
            available, including the thoughtful application of technology.
          </p>
          <h3>Refusing Pessimism</h3>
          <p>
            Stories set in the far future or in fantasy worlds often portray
            societal failures recognizable to contemporary audiences. These
            failures may include oppressive imbalances of wealth or power,
            degradation of natural habitat or processes, and impacts of climate
            change. Evidence of injustices, like social exclusion and
            environmental racism, may be present. Disastrous consequences are
            not necessarily averted but solarpunk tends to present a
            counter-dystopian perspective. Their worlds are not necessarily
            utopian but rather solarpunk seeks to present an alternative to a
            pessimistic, consequential dystopian outcome. To achieve this,
            themes of do it yourself ethics, convivial conservation,
            self-sustainability, social inclusiveness and positive psychology
            are often present. This perspective also more closely embeds the
            ideals of punk ideologies, such as anti-consumerism,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism"
              >egalitarianism</a
            >
            and decentralization, than cyberpunk which typically includes
            protagonists with punk beliefs but in settings that are used more as
            a warning of a potential future.

            />
          </aside>
          <h3>Sustainable Technology</h3>
          <p>
            The integration of technologies into society in a manner that
            improves social, economic and environmental sustainability is
            central to solarpunk. It is starkly contrasted to cyberpunk which
            portrays highly advanced technologies that have little influence on,
            or otherwise exacerbate social, economic, and environmental
            problems. Whereas cyberpunk envisions humanity becoming more
            alienated from its natural environment and subsumed by technology,
            solarpunk envisions settings where technology enables humanity to
            better co-exist with itself and its environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Solarpunk is more similar to steampunk than cyberpunk. Both
            steampunk and solarpunk imagine new worlds but with different
            primary sources of energy; respectively, the steam engines, and
            renewable energy. Though, whereas steampunk focuses more on history
            and uses Victorian era aesthetics, solarpunk uses more Art Nouveau
            style and looks to the future. Solarpunk also shares some elements
            with
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrofuturism"
              >retrofuturism</a
            >,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrofuturism">Afrofuturism</a
            >, Bionics and Arts and Crafts. The retrofuturist reevaluation of
            technology, its desire for understandable mechanics, and rejection
            of mysterious black box technology, and in favor of appropriate
            technology, are found in solarpunk works. As is the Afrofuturist's
            counter to mass-cultural homogeneity, the reckoning of injustices,
            and use of architecture and technology to correct power imbalances
            and problems in accessibility.
          </p>
          <h3>Do-It-Yourself Ethos</h3>
          <p>
            Although solarpunk is concerned with technology, it also embraces
            low-tech ways of living sustainably such as gardening, permaculture,
            regenerative design, tool libraries, maker spaces, open-source,
            positive psychology, metacognition, and do-it-yourself ethics. Its
            themes may reflect on environmental philosophy such as bright green
            environmentalism and social ecology, as well as punk ideologies such
            as anarchism, socialism, anti-consumerism, anti-authoritarianism,
            anti-capitalism, civil rights, commoning, and decentralization.
          </p>
          <h3>Racial & Gender Equality</h3>
          <p>
            Solarpunk often includes elements of racial and gender equality,
            drawing this theme from earlier utopian works. Marge Piercy's 1976
            classic Woman on the Edge of Time, explored family roles and
            introduced the pronoun 'per'. Ursula K. Le Guin's 1969 book The Left
            Hand of Darkness included gender fluidity. Her book The Dispossessed
            eliminated compulsory monogamy. Becky Chambers' 2021 solarpunk novel
            A Psalm for the Wild-Built included a main character who is
            non-binary.

          <p>
            As an art movement, solarpunk emerged in the 2010s as a reaction to
            the prevalence of bleak
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction"
              >post-apocalyptic</a
            >
            and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopian_fiction"
              >dystopian</a
            >
            media alongside an increased awareness of social injustices, impacts
            of climate change, and inextricable economic inequality. As
            post-apocalyptic and dystopian was ubiquitous in media, solarpunk
            became an attractive alternative. Solarpunk is optimistic yet
            realistic in confronting contemporary problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            The solarpunk visual identity, as expressed by Olivia Louise and
            subsequent artists, is compared to Art Nouveau with its depictions
            of plants, use of sinuous lines like whiplash, and integration of
            applied arts into fine arts. The ornamental Arts and Crafts
            movement, an influence on Art Nouveau, is present and its built
            forms reflect Frank Lloyd Wright's organic architecture. The
            solarpunk aesthetic typically utilizes natural colors, bright greens
            and blues, and allusions to diverse cultural origins. Examples of
            this aesthetic include Boeri Studio's Bosco Verticale in Milan, the
            depiction of Wakanda in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Studios"
              >Marvel Studios</a
            >' Black Panther and Auroa in Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint,
            Cities: Skylines's Green Cities expansion, and some
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli"
              >Studio Ghibli</a
            >
            movies, particularly Castle in the Sky and NausicaÃ¤ of the Valley of
            the Wind. Contrasted to cyberpunk which is portrayed as having a
            dark, grim aesthetic surrounded by an artificial and domineering
            built environment which is reflective of alienation and subjugation,
            solarpunk is bright, with light often used as a motif and in imagery
            to convey feelings of cleanliness, abundance and equability but,
            also, alternatively could be used to symbolize something that
            "subsumes everything beneath it, [an] emblem of tyranny [and]
            surveillance".

          <p>
            In literature, solarpunk is a subgenre within science fiction,
            though it may also include elements of other types of speculative
            fiction such as fantasy and utopian fiction. It is a cyberpunk
            derivative, contrasted to cyberpunk for its particular extrapolation
            of technology's impact on society and progress. Cyberpunk characters
            are typically those marginalized by rapid technological change or
            subsumed by technology, while the solarpunk archetype has been
            described as a "maker-hero" who has witnessed environmental disaster
            or failures by central authorities to adapt to crises or injustice,
            often in defense of nature and in ways that allow the story to
            illustrate optimistic outcomes. Its fictions illustrate feasible
            worlds that do not ignore the mechanics or ingredients of how it was
            arrived at.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously published novels that fit into this new genre included
            Ursula K. Le Guin's Always Coming Home (1985) and The Dispossessed
            (1974), Ernest Callenbach's Ecotopia (1975), Kim Stanley Robinson's
            Pacific Edge (1990), and Starhawk's The Fifth Sacred Thing (1993),
            largely for their depictions of contemporary worlds transitioning to
            more sustainable societies. However, the first explicit entries
            published into the genre were the short stories in anthologies
            Solarpunk: Ecological and Fantastic Stories in a Sustainable World
            (2012) (which was the third part of the publisher's trilogy of short
            story collections preceded by Vaporpunk and Dieselpunk), Wings of
            Renewal: A Solarpunk Dragons Anthology (2015), Sunvault: Stories of
            Solarpunk and Eco-Speculation (2017) and Glass and Gardens (2018).
            In 2018, author Becky Chambers agreed to write two solarpunk
            novellas for Tor Books and published A Psalm for the Wild-Built
            (2021) and A Prayer for the Crown-Shy (2022).
          </p>
          <p>
            In a 2019 Slate article, author Lee Konstantinou stated that
            solarpunk authors "...proclaim their commitment to "ingenuity,
            generativity, independence, and community", while going against the
            "nihilistic tendencies of cyberpunk and the reactionary tendencies
            of steampunk." He argues that solarpunk is aspirational, as it aims
            to provide "suggestions for the kind of science fiction or fantasy
            we ought to be writing". Solarpunk can include elements of mundane
            science fiction. In a Solarpunk Futures interview with Nina Munteanu
            about her solarpunk novel A Diary in the Age of Water, Munteanu said
            she incorporated elements of mundane science fiction to add "the
            gritty realism of the mundane" to the story.
          </p>
          <h3 id="film">Film</h3>
          <p>
            As in written fiction, solarpunk themes in film predate the
            recognition of solarpunk as a genre and the aesthetics and themes of
            the genre are increasingly present in contemporary works. Many of
            the works of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki"
              >Hayao Miyazaki</a
            >
            are recognized in hindsight as examples of early solarpunk cinema.
            Additionally, the intersection of ecological stewardship and science
            fiction have also appeared in numerous western animated films such
            as

            Examples of live action solarpunk cinema include James Cameron's

            In a study of the 44 most popular American science fiction films,
            nature was found to be ignored in visions of the future, depicted in
            cities with monoculture lawns and ornamental gardens. Nature is
            never portrayed in these films in an innovative or integrated way
            with future human civilization. At best, nature is simply portrayed
            as a background motif. The study suggested for artists to
            "collaborate to imagine how to integrate nature and biodiversity
            into the depictions of future cities".

            Some, like solarpunk researcher Adam Flynn, worry that solarpunk can
            risk being
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing">greenwashed</a>
            through aesthetics that give the appearance of sustainability
            without addressing the root causes of actual environmental issues.
            Flynn notes how depictions such as "luxury condos with a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_roof">green roof</a>
            that price out existing communities and might end up doing more
            environmental damage" is "fake solarpunk urbanism".

            Solarpunk architecture is characterized by combining natural
            elements with those of human society. It can be exemplified in small
            abodes that feature windmills or other green, diy off-grid
            technologies, as well as highly populated urban environments.

            Real-life examples of solarpunk architecture include the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Botanic_Gardens"
              >Singapore Botanic Gardens</a
            >
            which are one of only three gardens to be a UNESCO World Heritage
            Site; Italy's Bosco Verticale, which, in 2014, became the world's
            first oxygen-positive skyscraper; and Bolivia's Neo-Andean
            architecture by Freddy Mamani, which has successfully reclaimed
            traditional designs used by colonized peoples in a forward-thinking,
            sustainable way.
