            <h3>Literature</h3>
            <div>
                <p>In literature, solarpunk is a subgenre within science fiction, though it may also include elements of other types of speculative fiction such as fantasy and utopian fiction. It is a cyberpunk derivative, contrasted to cyberpunk for its particular extrapolation of technology's impact on society and progress. Cyberpunk characters are typically those marginalized by rapid technological change or subsumed by technology, while the solarpunk archetype has been described as a "maker-hero"[24] who has witnessed environmental disaster or failures by central authorities to adapt to crises or injustice, often in defense of nature and in ways that allow the story to illustrate optimistic outcomes. Its fictions illustrate feasible worlds that do not ignore the mechanics or ingredients of how it was arrived at.</p>
                <p>Previously published novels that fit into this new genre included Ursula K. Le Guin's Always Coming Home (1985) and The Dispossessed (1974), Ernest Callenbach's Ecotopia (1975), Kim Stanley Robinson's Pacific Edge (1990), and Starhawk's The Fifth Sacred Thing (1993), largely for their depictions of contemporary worlds transitioning to more sustainable societies.[25] However, the first explicit entries published into the genre were the short stories in anthologies Solarpunk: Ecological and Fantastic Stories in a Sustainable World (2012) (which was the third part of the publisher's trilogy of short story collections preceded by Vaporpunk and Dieselpunk), Wings of Renewal: A Solarpunk Dragons Anthology (2015), Sunvault: Stories of Solarpunk and Eco-Speculation (2017) and Glass and Gardens (2018). In 2018, author Becky Chambers agreed to write two solarpunk novellas for Tor Books and published A Psalm for the Wild-Built (2021) and A Prayer for the Crown-Shy (2022).</p>
                <p>In a 2019 Slate article, author Lee Konstantinou stated that solarpunk authors "...proclaim their commitment to "ingenuity, generativity, independence, and community", while going against the "nihilistic tendencies of cyberpunk and the reactionary tendencies of steampunk." He argues that solarpunk is aspirational, as it aims to provide "suggestions for the kind of science fiction or fantasy we ought to be writing". Solarpunk can include elements of mundane science fiction. In a Solarpunk Futures interview with Nina Munteanu about her solarpunk novel A Diary in the Age of Water, Munteanu said she incorporated elements of mundane science fiction to add "the gritty realism of the mundane" to the story.</p>

            <h3>Film</h3>
            <div>
                <p>As in written fiction, solarpunk themes in film predate the recognition of solarpunk as a genre and the aesthetics and themes of the genre are increasingly present in contemporary works. Many of the works of Hayao Miyazaki are recognized in hindsight as examples of early solarpunk cinema. Additionally, the intersection of ecological stewardship and science fiction have also appeared in numerous western animated films such as Treasure Planet (2002), WALL-E (2008), and Strange World (2022).</p>
                <p>Examples of live action solarpunk cinema include James Cameron's Avatar films and Benh Zeitlin's Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012).</p>
                <p>In a study of the 44 most popular American science fiction films, nature was found to be ignored in visions of the future, depicted in cities with monoculture lawns and ornamental gardens. Nature is never portrayed in these films in an innovative or integrated way with future human civilization. At best, nature is simply portrayed as a background motif. The study suggested for artists to "collaborate to imagine how to integrate nature and biodiversity into the depictions of future cities".</p>

            <h2>Criticism</h2>
            <hr>
            <div>
            <p>Some, like solarpunk researcher Adam Flynn, worry that solarpunk can risk being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing">greenwashed</a> through aesthetics that give the appearance of sustainability without addressing the root causes of actual environmental issues. Flynn notes how depictions such as "luxury condos with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_roof">green roof</a> that price out existing communities and might end up doing more environmental damage" is "fake solarpunk urbanism".</p>

            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <hr>
            <div>
                <p>Solarpunk architecture is characterized by combining natural elements with those of human society. It can be exemplified in small abodes that feature windmills or other green, diy off-grid technologies, as well as highly populated urban environments.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Real-life examples of solarpunk architecture include the Singapore Botanic Gardens, which are one of only three gardens to be a UNESCO World Heritage Site; Italy's Bosco Verticale, which, in 2014, became the world's first oxygen-positive skyscraper; and Bolivia's Neo-Andean architecture by Freddy Mamani, which has successfully reclaimed traditional designs used by colonized peoples in a forward-thinking, sustainable way.</p>
